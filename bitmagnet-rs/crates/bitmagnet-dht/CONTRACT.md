# Pure KRPC wire, scrape-bloom, and transaction-correlation parity

This crate owns only the offline byte boundary needed before a Rust DHT runtime
can be designed. Go remains the production implementation and the source of
truth. `internal/parity/dht_krpc_gen_test.go` runs the real Go bencode codec and
writes the checked fixture consumed by the Rust differential test.

The bounded contract includes:

- raw byte strings for transaction ID, message type, query, token, client ID,
  and error message; no UTF-8 assumption enters the wire;
- the Go KRPC envelope and its arguments/return projection, without imposing a
  later server's method/argument semantic validation;
- IPv4/IPv6 compact peer addresses, 26/38-byte compact nodes, and concatenated
  20-byte BEP-51 samples;
- exact canonical bencode bytes for typed fixtures; and
- Go-preserving presence: explicitly empty response tokens, samples, `want`,
  peer-value lists, and compact-node lists remain different from absent fields
  on encode. Go's custom compact-node decoder alone collapses an empty compact
  byte string back to nil; the fixture records that lossy canonical re-encode
  and Rust matches it.

The second bounded source-only slice adds BEP-33 without adding a client or
runtime:

- the exact 2,048-bit filter, two SHA-1-derived indexes, little-endian 16-bit
  index assembly, and least-significant-bit-first bit placement;
- raw IP-byte insertion, preserving Go's important distinction between a
  four-byte IPv4 and the sixteen-byte `net.IPv4` representation;
- Go's floating `EstimateCount` and the rounded finite `ApproximatedSize` used
  by persistence; an empty filter estimates about half an item and a full
  filter estimates positive infinity; and
- pointer-sensitive `BFsd` (seeders) and `BFpe` (peers) return fields, including
  the difference between omission and a present all-zero 256-byte filter.

The third bounded source-only slice adds only the transaction-correlation core:

- fallible cryptographic two-byte transaction IDs, injectable deterministic
  issuance, a bounded 65,536-attempt collision loop, and distinct source,
  full-space, and collision-exhaustion failures;
- atomic register-before-send typestate: `RegisteredQuery` owns an already
  inserted exact query message and canonical wire bytes, then transfers its
  generation receipt to `PendingTransaction` only after the send succeeds;
- generation-checked cleanup on send failure, cancellation, timeout, registry
  close, task abort, and either typestate guard being dropped, preventing a
  stale guard from deleting a later query that reused the same TID;
- response/error type gating, exact TID lookup, normalized source-address
  gating, and explicit first-wins delivery in that order. Plain IPv4 aliases
  only a zero-scope IPv4-mapped address; Rust preserves a nonzero mapped scope
  fail-closed, while native IPv6 requires equal scope and ignores flowinfo; and
- typed success, remote-error, missing-body, timeout, cancellation, and closed
  outcomes that retain the accepted source address and full response envelope.

`internal/protocol/dht/server/transaction_parity_gen_test.go` exercises the
actual Go `Query`, `send`, `handleResponse`, and `addrMatches` paths. Its fake
socket asserts synchronously inside `Send` that the TID and destination are
already registered, and the checked fixture locks canonical query bytes,
collision retry, address normalization, duplicate delivery, and every terminal
cleanup path to the Rust differential tests.

Go accepts more bencode syntax than the pinned `bendy =0.6.1` decoder. The
fixture therefore probes unsorted/duplicate dictionary keys, noncanonical
integers, unknown fields, trailing values, missing `t`/`y`, `ro=0`, and the
legacy bare-string error. It also records Go's unusual boolean compatibility:
integers, byte strings, and recursively singleton lists canonicalize to an
integer flag. Rust intentionally rejects unsorted and duplicate
keys at the strict syntax boundary even though Go accepts them. This known
compatibility difference is gated. Both codecs reject non-20-byte IDs. The
oracle also records one intentional shape hardening: Rust rejects non-6/18-byte
compact peer addresses that Go's generic IP decoding accepts. It likewise
records that Go's generic fixed-array decoder pads/truncates non-256-byte
BEP-33 filters while Rust requires the exact protocol width. These known
differences mean this crate is **not yet admitted as an inbound live-network
codec**.
Unknown keys remain forward-compatible and are ignored like Go; accepted
noncanonical projections re-encode canonically.

Excluded from this milestone: UDP/TCP sockets and receive loops, live query
wiring, routing tables, responders, a BEP-33 scrape client or scheduler, BEP-44
mutable/immutable storage and signing, BEP-51 scheduling, BEP-9/10 metadata
transfer, crawler orchestration, PostgreSQL, queues, images, and deployment.
The pure registry is not connected to production and this crate remains **not
admitted for live inbound DHT traffic**. No live DHT behavior changes.
